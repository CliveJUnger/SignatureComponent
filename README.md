# TX Notary Signature Component

Boilerplate code forked from [StepenGrider](https://github.com/StephenGrider/ReduxSimpleStarter)

This component allows users to create an electronic signature using their mouse or finger(mobile). The signature is then used to populate the TX notary application along with other user data. In this instance, dumby data is used instead of real inputed data.
